## Code of Conduct

### Our Pledge

We, the maintainers, contributors, and community members of the **Bloggen.dev ecosystem** and related open-source projects by **Silverthread Labs**, pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free, inclusive, and respectful experience for everyone — regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity or expression, experience level, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We commit to fostering a welcoming and productive environment where ideas can be shared, challenged, and improved in a spirit of mutual respect and collaboration.

### Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive and supportive environment include:

* Showing empathy and kindness toward others
* Respecting differing opinions, perspectives, and experiences
* Offering and receiving constructive feedback with grace
* Taking responsibility for mistakes and learning from them
* Prioritizing the long-term health of the community over personal interests

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* Sexualized language, imagery, or attention in any context
* Trolling, insults, or discriminatory comments
* Personal or political attacks
* Harassment, public or private
* Sharing private information (such as personal contact details) without explicit consent
* Any behavior deemed unprofessional, abusive, or harmful

### Enforcement Responsibilities

**Silverthread Labs** and designated project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing these standards. We will take appropriate, fair, and transparent action in response to behavior that violates this Code of Conduct.

We reserve the right to moderate or remove any content — including issues, commits, comments, and pull requests — that is not aligned with these standards. Whenever possible, we will provide a rationale for moderation decisions.

### Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to all spaces managed by Silverthread Labs, including but not limited to:

* GitHub repositories under the Silverthread Labs organization
* Discussions, issue threads, and pull requests
* Official community channels (e.g., [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/DukeOfAllTrades/))

### Enforcement

To report abuse, harassment, or any violation of this Code of Conduct, please email **[silverthreadlabs@gmail.com](mailto:silverthreadlabs@gmail.com)**. All reports will be handled discreetly, reviewed promptly, and investigated fairly.

We are committed to protecting the privacy and safety of reporters and will take every reasonable step to maintain confidentiality.
